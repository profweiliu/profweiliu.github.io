## More general hypothesis testing
Suppose we are interested in testing one of the following sets of hypotheses:
$$
\begin{array}{rll}
H_{0}: \theta=\theta_{0} & \text { vs } & H_{1}: \theta \neq \theta_{0} \\
H_{0}: a \leq \theta \leq b & \text { vs } & H_{1}: \theta<a \text { or } b<\theta
\end{array}
$$
### General LRT for composite hypotheses
#### Well-seperated cases


#### T-test and one-sample normal model
